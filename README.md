# React, Vite project Sneaker spot 2023

So decided to do a sneaker store project, got the idea when working on an earlier project we had, when designing a prototype in figma.

So will do this in React, Vite, use Sass, Framer-motion, react-icons, some own figma designs, svgs, and css hamburger button and some more... fun things.
